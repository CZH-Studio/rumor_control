reddit:
For Reddit, the RecSys is modeled based on Reddit’s disclosed post ranking algorithm (Salihefendic,
 2015), which calculates a hot score to prioritize posts. This score integrates likes, dislikes, and
 created time, ensuring that the most recent and popular posts are ranked at the top, while those less
 popular or controversial rank lower. Specifically, the calculation formula is:
                    h =log10(max(|u−d|,1))+sign(u−d)· (t−t0)/45000
 where h indicates the hot score, u represents the number of upvotes, d represents the number of
 downvotes, and t is the submission time in seconds since the Unix epoch, t0 = 1134028003. it
 rank the posts based on hot scores to identify the top k posts for recommendation, with the number
 of recommended posts (i.e., k) varying depending on the experiment

For Reddit, the RecSys recommend based on interest matching using TwHIN-BERT, a pre-trained BERT model trained on Twitter data 
which models user interests based on profiles and recent activities by vectors’ similarity. Factors like 
recency (prioritizing newer posts) and the number of followers of the post’s creator (simulating superuser 
broadcasting) are also taken into account to recommend relevant posts.
specifically, the recommendation algorithm calculates the score between a post and a user using:
            Score = R×F×S
 where:
            R = ln((271.8−(tcurrent −tcreated))/100)
            F = max(1,log1000(fan_count + 1))
            S = cosine similarity(Ep,Eu)
In this context:
 • R refers to the recency score.
 • tcurrent represents the current timestamp.
 • tcreated refers to the timestamp when the post was created.
 • F refers to the fan count score.
 • Ep is the embedding of the post content.
 • Eu is the embedding of the user profile and recent post content.
 • S refers to the cosine similarity between the embeddings Ep and Eu calculated by TwHIN-BERT.
