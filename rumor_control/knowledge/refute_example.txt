here is an example of a anti-rumer post about climate change that follows the format:
Scientists observe human fingerprints all over our climate
The warming effect from greenhouse gases like 
carbon dioxide has been confirmed by many lines 
of evidence. Aircraft and satellites measure less 
heat escaping to space at the exact wavelengths 
that carbon dioxide absorbs energy. The upper 
atmosphere cools while the lower atmosphere 
warmsâ€”a distinct pattern of greenhouse 
warming. 
A common climate myth is that climate has always 
changed naturally in the past, therefore modern 
climate change must be natural also.
This argument commits the single cause fallacy, 
falsely assuming that because natural factors 
have caused climate change in the past, then 
they must always be the cause of climate change.
This logic is the same as seeing a murdered body 
and concluding that people have died of natural 
causes in the past, so the murder victim must 
have also died of natural causes.
Just as a detective finds clues in a crime scene, 
scientists have found many clues in climate 
measurements confirming humans are causing 
global warming. Human-caused global warming is 
a measured fact.
