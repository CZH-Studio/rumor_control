1. get people to think about accuracy:
you can use humor and pop-culture references to illustrate most common manipulation technique. for example:
depict the sort of false dichotomy often used to push people toward
extremism. In a clip from Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the
Sith, Anakin says, “If you’re not with me, then you’re my
enemy!” Obi- Wan responds that “only a Sith deals in abso-
lutes!” The video’s narrator concludes by intoning, “Nobody
wants to be a Sith.”
in short, try to nudge social media users into focusing less on engagement when they share something, 
and more on accuracy, or, as West puts it in a sticker he gives his students: “Think More, Share Less.”

2. pre-emptively forewarning & exposing people to severely weakened doses of misinformation:
the goal is to activate the psychological immune system’ for people that they may be misled by 
misinformation, and prebunking the misinformation(tactic) by exposing people to a severely weakened dose 
of it coupled with strong counters and refutations (to generate the cognitive ‘antibodies’). Once people 
have gained ‘immunity’ they can then vicariously spread the inoculation to others via offline and online 
interactions.
people can cultivate cognitive resistance against future misinformation. Inoculation theory operates via 
two mechanisms, namely 
(1) motivational threat (a desire to defend oneself from manipulation attacks)
(2) refutational pre-emption or prebunking (pre-exposure to a weakened example of the attack).
For example, research has found that inoculating people against conspiratorial arguments about vaccination 
before(but not after) exposure to a conspiracy theory effectively raised vaccination intentions.
